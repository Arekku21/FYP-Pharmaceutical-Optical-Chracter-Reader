## About <a name = "about"></a>

The project Pharmaceutical Optical Character Recognition System is an AI system that allows Pharmacy users to scan medicine strips and retrieve information such as dosage, brand and active ingredients to identify the medicine. Additionally, the system also has a complete Point-of-sale (POS) system that accompanies the OCR module and allows full capability of managing employees, sales, storing medicine information in database and other business related functions for the pharmacy.

Using current standard Optical Character Recognition AI such as EasyOCR, PaddleOCR and Google Tesseract to retrieve the information, the system also has additional functionality and modules that enhances the system such as Fuzzy Search algorithm that suggest the closest medicine from records and retraining pipeline. To add on, the system is also built with the motivation to allow a 'plug and play' system that each module can be used separately for other systems and research since it will be open-sourced.

Lastly, the system also includes deployability with Virtual Machine Images for each OCR API server and as well as the POS system with a possible future update for docker images as well.Â
