**Tired of going through all images in a folder and comparing them manually to check if they are duplicates?**

:white_check_mark: The Duplicate Image Finder (difPy) Python package **automates** this task for you!

```python
pip install difPy
```
> :point_right: :new: **[difPy v3.0](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/releases/tag/v3.0.1)** has been released! Count on signifcant **performance increases**, **new features** and **bug fixes**. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/releases/) for a detailed listing. 

> :open_hands: Our motto? We :heart: Open Source! **Contributions and new ideas for difPy are always welcome** - check our [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/wiki/Contributing-to-difPy) for more information.

## Description
DifPy searches for images in **one or more different folders**, compares the images it found and checks whether these are duplicates. It then outputs the **image files classified as duplicates** as well as the **images having the lowest resolutions**, so you know which of the duplicate images are safe to be deleted. You can then either delete them manually, or let difPy delete them for you.

</p>

DifPy does not compare images based on their hashes. It compares them based on their tensors i. e. the image content - this allows difPy to **not only search for duplicate images, but also for similar images**.

## Basic Usage
Use the following function to make difPy search for duplicates within one specific folder and its subfolders:

```python
from difPy import dif
search = dif("C:/Path/to/Folder/")
``` 
:new: **[difPy v3.0](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/releases/tag/v3.0.1)** now supports **multi-folder search**! To search for duplicates within mutliple folders and their subfolders:

```python
from difPy import dif
search = dif(["C:/Path/to/Folder_A/", "C:/Path/to/Folder_B/", "C:/Path/to/Folder_C/", ... ])
``` 
Folder paths must be specified as standalone Python strings, or within a Python list.

:notebook: For a **detailed usage guide**, please view the official **[difPy Usage Documentation](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/wiki/difPy-Usage-Documentation)**.

## Output
DifPy returns various types of output that you may use depending on your use case: 

A **JSON formatted collection** of duplicates/similar images (i. e. **match groups**) that were found, where the keys are a **randomly generated unique id** for each image file:

```python
search.result

> Output:
{20220819171549 : {"location" : "C:/Path/to/Image/image1.jpg",
                   "matches" : {30270813251529 : "location": "C:/Path/to/Image/matched_image1.jpg",
                                                 "mse": 0.0},
                               {72214282557852 : "location": "C:/Path/to/Image/matched_image2.jpg",
                                                 "mse": 0.0},
                   ... }
 ...
}
``` 
:new: **[difPy v3.0](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/releases/tag/v3.0.1)** now outputs the **MSE** value for each matched image!

A **list** of duplicates/similar images that have the **lowest quality** among match groups: 

```python
search.lower_quality

> Output:
["C:/Path/to/Image/duplicate_image1.jpg", 
 "C:/Path/to/Image/duplicate_image2.jpg", ...]
``` 
A **JSON formatted collection** with statistics on the completed difPy process:

```python
search.stats

> Output:
{"directory" : ("C:/Path/to/Folder_A/", "C:/Path/to/Folder_B/", ... ),
 "duration" : {"start_date": "2023-02-15",
               "start_time" : "18:44:19",
               "end_date" : "2023-02-15",
               "end_time" : "18:44:38",
               "seconds_elapsed" : 18.6113},
 "fast_search": True,
 "recursive" : True,
 "match_mse" : 200,
 "files_searched" : 1032,
 "matches_found" : 852,
 "invalid_files": {"count": 4, 
                   "logs": {...}}}
``` 
:new: **[difPy v3.0](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/releases/tag/v3.0.1)** now outputs the count of **invalid files** in the target directory that could not be processed as images, as well as information on whether difPy's **Fast Search Algorithm (FSA)** was used.

## Additional Parameters
DifPy supports the following parameters:

```python
dif(*directory, fast_search=True, recursive=True, similarity="normal", px_size=50, 
    show_progress=True, show_output=False, delete=False, silent_del=False)
```
:new: **[difPy v3.0](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/releases/tag/v3.0.1)** now supports the use of its new **Fast Search Algorithm (FSA)**, capable of providing significant performance increases.

:notebook: For a **detailed usage guide**, please view the official **[difPy Usage Documentation](https://github.com/elisemercury/Duplicate-Image-Finder/wiki/difPy-Usage-Documentation)**.

## CLI Usage
You can make use of difPy through a CLI interface by using the following commands:

```python
python dif.py -D "C:/Path/to/Folder/"

python dif.py -D"C:/Path/to/Folder_A/" "C:/Path/to/Folder_B/" "C:/Path/to/Folder_C/"
```
It supports the following arguments:

```python
dif.py [-h] -D DIRECTORY [-Z [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]] [-f [FAST_SEARCH]]
       [-r [{True,False}]] [-s [{low,normal,high,int}]] [-px [PX_SIZE]] 
       [-p [{True,False}]] [-o [{True,False}]]
       [-d [{True,False}]] [-sd [{True,False}]]
```

| | Parameter | | Parameter |
| :---: | ------ | :---: | ------ | 
| `-D` | directory | `-px` | px_size |  
| `-Z` | output_directory | `-p` | show_progress |
| `-f`| fast_search | `-o` | show_output |
| `-r`| recursive | `-d` | delete |
| `-s` | similarity |  `-sd` | silent_del |


When running from the CLI, the output of difPy is  written to files and saved in the working directory by default. To change the default output directory, specify the `-Z / -output_directory` parameter. The "xxx" in the output filenames is a unique timestamp:

```python
difPy_results_xxx.json
difPy_lower_quality_xxx.csv
difPy_stats_xxx.json
```
